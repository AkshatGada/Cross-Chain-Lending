# Cross-Chain Lending: Morpho Blue Cross-Chain Collateral Design Pattern ( WIP )

<!-- Note: The core scripts for the cross-chain lending workflows have been completed. Integration with AggSandbox is underway, and we are actively developing the frontends and polishing the full end-to-end workflow. Please see the detailed description below for the complete implementation and usage notes. -->

## Overview

Cross-Chain Lending demonstrates **fundamental concepts** of using assets from one blockchain as collateral to borrow on another blockchain. This educational example shows how to bridge LP tokens from Sepolia and use them as collateral in Morpho Blue's isolated lending markets on Tatara (Katana testnet) to borrow AUSD, showcasing advanced DeFi composability across chains.

### Learning Objectives

| Concept | What You'll Learn | Real-World Application |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Isolated Lending Markets** | How Morpho Blue creates risk-isolated lending pools | Advanced lending protocol design |
| **Cross-Chain Collateral** | Using assets from one chain as collateral on another | Multi-chain capital efficiency |
| **Oracle Integration** | Price feeds for non-standard collateral types | Custom asset valuation systems |
| **Risk Parameters** | LTV ratios and liquidation mechanics | DeFi risk management |

## 1. Understanding Morpho Blue Architecture

### 1.1 What Makes Morpho Blue Different

**Traditional Lending vs Isolated Markets**:

```
Traditional Lending (Compound/Aave)
├── Shared risk pools
├── System-wide liquidation risk
└── Limited asset support

Morpho Blue Isolated Markets
├── Each market is independent
├── Isolated risk per market
└── Any asset can have its own market
```

### 1.2 Market Structure Components

A Morpho Blue market consists of:

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Loan Token** | What users borrow | AUSD |
| **Collateral Token** | What users deposit | LP tokens from Sepolia |
| **Oracle** | Price feed for collateral | Custom LP token oracle |
| **IRM** | Interest rate model | Dynamic rate based on utilization |
| **LLTV** | Liquidation Loan-to-Value | 86% (860000000000000000) |

### 1.3 The Isolated Market Advantage

**Why Isolation Matters**:
- Each market has independent risk parameters
- Bad debt in one market doesn't affect others
- Custom oracles for exotic collateral types
- Flexible interest rate models per asset pair

## 2. Cross-Chain Collateral Logic

### 2.1 The Collateral Bridge Pattern

**File**: `scripts/morpho-complete-test.js`

**Core Concept**: Instead of just bridging tokens for trading, we bridge them with lending instructions.

**Cross-Chain Flow Design**:

```
Sepolia LP Position
    │
    ├── LP tokens represent liquidity provision
    ├── Have inherent value from underlying assets
    └── Exist as ERC-20 tokens
    │
Bridge + Lending Instructions
    │
    ├── Bridge LP tokens to Tatara
    ├── Include market parameters
    ├── Include borrowing preferences
    └── Execute lending operations automatically
    │
Tatara Lending Market
    │
    ├── Receive LP tokens as collateral
    ├── Create/verify market exists
    ├── Supply collateral to Morpho
    └── Borrow AUSD against collateral
```

### 2.2 Collateral Valuation Challenge

**Educational Insight**: LP tokens are complex assets that require custom price oracles.

**LP Token Value Components**:
- Underlying Token A reserves
- Underlying Token B reserves  
- Current exchange rates
- Pool fees accumulated
- Impermanent loss considerations
